I would like to be considered for the user experience engineer position at GE.  I am interested in working with a cross-functional team of managers, end users, and business leaders to develop delightful experiences for a new product.  

At my current job at Ford Research (close by, in Dearborn), I have created my own version of 'agile' UX development in which I produce wireframes or UI prototypes for my team every 2 weeks.  I am eager to learn how GE does agile development and figure out how my techniques can fit in.  As I create UI prototypes, I am using basic AngularJS directives, and I would like to use this opportunity at GE to develop more in-depth skills in Javascript frameworks. It'll help me build faster and cleaner prototypes too.  
\smallskip

 From a skills standpoint, I believe I would be a good fit for the position because:


1. I am a UX designer with experience in user research, wireframing, front-end UI prototyping, usability testing, writing requirements;

2. I believe in a user-driven design approach, where the needs and wants of the user base should provide a foundation for building a product;

3.  My favorite part of the process is in the creative side - sketching, creating paper prototypes, interviewing users, and translating my results into digital Illustrator concepts;

4. I enjoy communicating my design process to project stakeholders and I strive to support my design decisions with qualitative (interviews) or quantitative (survey) data;

5. I experiment with new devices, design techniques, and APIs in the market to see how they can fit into my personal and professional projects;

6. I am developing my front-end development skills to prototype on my own and  know the limitations to my design;

7. I am always pushing myself to learn more and provide new value to my teams and projects.

You can see examples of my work at www.aiswaryakolisetty.com/work.html.  I maintain a weekly blog to consolidate life lessons and to improve my writing at www.aiswaryakolisetty.com/blog.html.    

I would love the opportunity to speak with you and discuss how my skillset can help enhance the user experience of GE's products.
