			<div class="work-header"><h3> For the European city commuter </h3></div>


      <h4> The Context </h4>


			<p>I spent May-August 2010 working with nanotechnology research institute <a href = "http://www2.imec.be/be_en/home.html">imec</a href> in Leuven, Belgium.  (What a Euro trip that was!)   </p>

      <h4> The Project </h4>
      <p> The aim was to design a concept vehicle with a futuristic aesthetic and high-technology integration. The target market was Europeans that commute in the big cities - crowded, dense, and restrictive to cars.  The opportunity lay in the segment between bicycle commuters that are everywhere and the burdensome car commuters that are stuck in traffic.  </p>

      <div id="photo-div" style="float:right; height:160px;"><img src="Work/aura/thecar.png"/></div> 

      <p><b style="color:#d9401e">Result: </b> A fellow intern and I designed <i>Aura</i>, a 3-wheeled recumbed pedal-powered electric vehicle that aims to preseve the exhilaration of a bicycle ride and integrate the comfort of a car.  Our user segment demanded this option if it was modern, attractive, and kept them less sweaty on the way to work.  Aura is a sustainable creation, with a 'cradle-to-cradle' manufacturing cycle. </p>

      <h4>Features </h4>

      <p> Engineering design: rear-hub electric motor, the mechanical system, integration with pedal power.  Controls system: allows the vehicle to decide when to provide electric-assist, smartphone integration (manufacturer-agnostic). Physical design: We sketched tens of initial designs of the interior and exterior. </p>

      <div id="photo-div" style="float:left; height:140px;"><img src="Work/aura/views_auracar.JPG"/></div> 

      <p>Ecosystem:  Aura is more than just a vehicle. It is an accessory, a partner in connecting with the community via the smartphone.  The high-tech integration allows the modern-day commuter to embrace the power of personalization, activity tracking, and sustainable transportation.</p>

     <br>
      <h4> The Reflection </h4>
      <p>I worked with an expert artist, engineering students at the GroepT university in Belgium, and my imagination.  It was such a rewarding experience to design a system froma blank state. </p> 
      <p>The following summer, Aura was put into the prototype stage by imec.  I hope vehicles like Aura come to life in the future. </p>
