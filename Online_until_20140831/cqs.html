      <h4> The Context </h4>


			<p>I spent May-August 2010 working with a Belgian racing team at <a href = "http://www.groept.be">GroepT University</a href> in Leuven, Belgium. </p>

      <h4> The Project </h4>
      <p> The team developed vehicle with alternative energy drive trains - <i>Pegasus</i> on biethanol and <i>Odyssee</i> on electricity.  Both cars participated in the 24h24' race for 2CVs at Spa-Francorchamps (home of the Belgian Grand Prix).</p>
       <div id="photo-div" style="float:right; height:150px;"><img src="Work/cqs/odyssee.jpg"/></div> 
      <p>   A fellow intern and I were helping them improve Odyssee before the big race. I worked on reliably transmitting vehicle data from the car on the track to the team in the pit. A second project involved making their software more modular.</p>

     

      <p><b style="color:#d9401e">Result: </b> We successfully tested the wireless communication between the car and the pit at a test race at Circuite de Bresse in July.  For the second project, I redesigned part of the software to make it more modular for future improvements.   </p>

      <h4>Process </h4>

      <div id="photo-div" style="float:left; height:120px;"><img src="Work/cqs/xbee.JPG"/></div> 

      <p> Wireless communication - I worked with Xbee modules to transmit data using the RS232 protocol between the car and pit.  Wireless data was read, saved, and analyzed; all was done using LabView, mySQL, and Java.  Incoming GPS data was plotted real-time on Google Maps to show the car's position on the track. </p>

      <p> Software redesign - An interface was developed to modularly add new sensors and signals to the data monitoring system when Odyssee is updated in the future. </p>



     <br>
      <h4> The Reflection </h4>
      <p>This was my first exposure to a startup-like environment.  I learned lessons on feature ownership and agile development. I improved my skills in Java and picked up any new software skills as I needed them.  <i>Learning how to learn</i> is a powerful life skill.  </p>
