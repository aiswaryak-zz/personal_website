      <h4> The Context </h4>


			<p>Myndr is an iPhone app aimed to bring agency to the lives of people suffering mild-memory loss or early-stage Alzheimer's disease. It forms a connection between a caregiver and the person with memory-loss. The aim is ease streess on their relationship that can build-up with symptoms of the condition.   </p>

      <h4> The Project </h4>
      <p> The app allows a person with memory loss to look up frequently asked questions, frequent contacts, and timed action items.  All of this content is programmed by the caretaker on a website that syncs with the app on the memory-lossed person's phone.  </p>

      <p>The app was already technically built by founder Aaron Boxer, when I joined the project under the <a href = "http://aging.olin.edu/index.html">Olin Ageing Research Group </a>.  However, Aaron recognized that while he has a functioning prototype, it needs to be tested with users to be deemed useful.  He worked with me and a classmate to get into old-age homes and bring the app to them.  </p>

      <p> We started with interviews.  We spoke to people of older age at the retirement home near Olin and we got them to use touch technology.  The results proved we have a challenge on our hands. The technology is foreign to older adults who have reactions like - "I pushed it with my nail and nothing happened", "Is this a button?", "I'm not sure what will happen if I touch this."  The evident fear-of-the-unknown was the first sign that designing a mobile app might not be the right direction. </p>

           <p><b style="color:#d9401e">Result: </b>

       <p> At the time I was on the project, we were still user testing Myndr with older adults to get an assessment on how much value it provides them and their caretaker.  Those people who were already familiar with technology were able to concentrate on content-feedback for the app. Those who didn't have exposure to smart devices spent a great deal of their time figuring out how to use an iPhone. </p>
     
     <br>
      <h4> The Reflection </h4>
      <p>I was always interested in the intersection of technology and older-age people who didn't grow up with computers and smart devices.  On one hand you see savvy grandmothers with iPads, and on the other hand is my grandad who still writes letters and struggles to understand the value of a cellphone. </p>
      <p> I learned a lot during this research project about the discord between technology and elderly people.  Those who are unfamiliar with technology are frustrated, alienated, and sick of the attention and glamour surrounding it.  Those who have learned and kept up with technology find it fascinating and brilliant that Skype can let them talk to grandkids at any time of day. </p>
      <p>  Seeing these polarized conceptions of technology shows that if technology is to become ubiquitous, much more work has to be done in the domains of late adoption and intuitive user-centric design. </p>
