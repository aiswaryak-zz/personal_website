      <h4> The Context </h4>


			<p>Olin's Affordable Design and Entrepreneurship (ADE) course works with partners in international sites. I was on the India team and I worked on the <a href="http://www.zimbawater.com">Zimba</a> water chlorination system. Our partner and Zimba's primary inventor, Suprio Das, is based in Calcutta, India.   </p>

      <h4> The Project </h4>
      <p><b style="color:#d9401e">Aim: </b> Zimba seeks to prevent illness by providing affordable and clean water to Indian communities in slums and villages. The Zimba was in initial prototype stage and required to be designed for manufacturing. Our team experimented with building a smaller version that could be easily manufactured. We researched how the chlorine supply chain could replenish the Zimba periodically.  </p>
      <p><b style="color:#d9401e">Result: </b> Our team visited India and brought several Zimba prototype models with us. We worked with the communities who needed clean drinking water.  We understood that before we commit massive redesigns to the Zimba product, we need to work with their habits handling water in the household.  Clean practices around maintenance and storage of water should be encourage in conjunction with the Zimba redesign.  </p>

      <h4> The Design </h4>
      
      <ul>
          <li type="square">How Zimba Works <p>The Zimba is introduced at point-of-collection of drinking water. It contains a siphon mechanism that ensures that an accurate dose of chlorine is added to water. This effectively disinfects the water at it is pumped into the user's bucket. </p></li>
          <li type="square">Issues to Address</li>
          <p>We noted that the Zimba is too tall to fit under a majority of hand pumps in India. This meant that a height reduction in the product is necessary.</p>
          <p>Second, a sustainable business model was necessary for the company to continue operation and build a network of supporting NGOs.</p>
          
          <li type="square">Experimentation</li>
          <p> The height of the Zimba is being limited to the siphon inside. The goal was to reduce the height of the siphon while maintaining performance. We tried several experiments using PVC piping.  Towards the end of the semester, we were able to produce reduced heights for the siphon.</p>

           <li type="square">Trip to Calcutta</li>
          <p> We travelled to India in December 2012 to meet Suprio, visit communities that will use Zimba, and test our prototype.  We travelled to garbage dumping rounds, tourist sites, and rural villages neighboring Bangaldesh. We drank a lot of chai too. </p>
          <p> One community that had a few Zimba prototypes lived beside the garbage dump. We spent several days with them and tested with the Zimba.  We met the NGO named GOAL that is working to implement Zimba in the community.  We conducted user interviews of slum dwellers and got feedback on product improvement.</p>
      </ul>


      <h4> The Reflection </h4>
      <p>We visited India for 3 weeks. It was a revealing experience to my own country and I learned a lot about engineering, design, and our end customers with certain needs and wants and mindsets. </p>
