            <p>Over the past few weeks, I've been spending a lot of time with myself.  I moved into a new apartment and I'm living alone for the first time, I had a leg injury and had to take a break from activities, and work got a little busier.  I began thinking about the person I've become.  At 23 years old, what is my character?  How do I behave in certain situations? What is it that makes me unique, interesting?  There had to be parts of me that light up, that always came to the rescue, that I could count on.  </p>

			<p> In an attempt to highlight a few of those behaviors, I decided to visualize the hyperbole of each one.  An exagerration that was borderline insane.  This allows me to play around a little with the creative expression.  </p>
			
			<p> From a development perspective, I hope that outlining these habits or behaviors makes me more self-aware of how I am, how I can use these them to help others or help myself, and how I can tone them down if appropriate.</p>
			
			<p> The medium I'm using for these visuals is Inkscape, a free alternative to Adobe Illustrator and a software I've wanted to learn.  This is my first project in Inkscape. Some illustrations are up, more are to come.</p>

					  <h5>For the past year, I've developed the terribly expensive habit of stopping at Starbucks on the way to work <i>everyday</i>.  If I didn't have time in the morning, I'd make an afternoon run instead.  If I didn't empty a Starbucks cup that day, some part of me was missing.  More recently, I've toned the habit down a bit. But mind you, I was collecting a lot of stars for my dedication... </h5>

					  <h5>Maybe  my tendency to ask questions comes from the work I do as a user experience designer.  After all, I try to understand the way others live.  But back in college, I think I consciously made this behavior change.  I came to view my conversations with others as a knowledge exchange.  A way to learn something new and hopefully reciprocate.  For a few years now, I have been happy to let the person talk in order to learn from them.  Hopefully it's making me a better listener.  This illustration is an ode to a favorite college game, <i>Kings</i>, where picking the <i>Queen</i> card meant you became the question master - tricking others into answering your questions.

					  <h5>I fell in love with international politics in high school.  In Model UN, I represented some rebellious countries - Israel, Iran, to name two.  The more volatile the country, the more research I needed to be an effective diplomat.  Over time, that developed into an interest for politics in the places I was living - India, the US, a little while in Europe.  Now pile on TV shows like Homeland, and it's a career daydream waiting to happen.  Have to say, I certainly have the BBC intel to get me going in the right direction.
