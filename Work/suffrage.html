            <p>I worked on the user-interface for an iOS app for my humanities capstone project at Olin.  It is accompanied by a <b style="color:#d9401e"><a href= "http://digitalcommons.olin.edu/ahs_capstone_2013/19/">paper</a></b> unearthing comparisons between the perceptions of American youth and Indian youth on politics, elections, and voting in their country.</p>

            <p> To design a user interface for a mobile app that can allow conversations and stories of voting and elections to be shared by youth from across the world - with differing nationalities, governments, and ways of life. The idea came after user research on American youth and Indian youth viewpoints on elections and voting.  

     
            <p><b style="color:#d9401e">Result: </b> A  <b style="color:#d9401e"><a href= "http://digitalcommons.olin.edu/ahs_capstone_2013/19/">paper</a></b> was published and a user interface was designed in XCode for an iPhone.  I was able to build a bridge between ethnographic research and technology to address societal issues the research unearthed. </p>

      <p>The two parts of this project: </p>

      <ul>
          <li type="square">I interviewed a dozen college-age youth in India and the USA to figure out what their political views are, whether they have voted, why they voted, and what motivates them to participate in elections and politics.  Those narratives were synthesized into a cohesive <b style="color:#d9401e"><a href= "http://digitalcommons.olin.edu/ahs_capstone_2013/19/">paper</a></b> that brings to light the differences and similarities in mindsets between both groups.  </li>
          <br>
          <li type="square">I learned how to program in Objective-C to build the UI for an iPhone app.  This required that I take the learnings from the paper and bring elements to the app that address areas of opportunity to better engage youth.  The <a href = "http://youtu.be/KHxKLjDzb0A">video</a> below walks through the app.</li>
      </ul>

         <p>First, a huge thank you to my mentor, a history professor at Wellesley College, who stuck with me for the duration of this project.  We both came from different backgrounds and while I struggled to piece together a literary paper, he was on new territory to evaluate how I built an app interface. But we learned from each other, and for that I'm grateful.  </p>
          <p> Second, I learned a lot about how mindsets differ between people in young and mature democracies.  I think Indian youth (including myself) have a lot to learn about politics in our country.  We complain a lot about corruption and alternate agendas, but don't have much grasp of the political landscape to do much about it.  I think the youth in the US also see issues in politics, but are invested and knowledgeable on major issues to openly demand for the change they want.  </p>
