It forms a connection between a caregiver and the person with memory-loss. The aim is ease streess on their relationship that can build-up with symptoms of the condition.   </p>

            <p>The app was already technically built by founder Aaron Boxer, when I joined the project under the <b style="color:#d9401e"><a href = "http://aging.olin.edu/index.html">Olin Ageing Research Group </a></b>.  However, Aaron recognized that while he has a functioning prototype, it needs to be tested with users to be deemed useful.  He worked with me and a classmate to get into old-age homes and bring the app to them.  </p>

            <p> We spoke to people of older age at the retirement home near Olin and asked them to use touch technology.  This proved to be a major learning lesson for our team, as we noticed how foriegn smartphones and touch mechanisms are to older adults. We worked with Aaron to modify the app and make it more usable by the aging population.  


            <p><b style="color:#d9401e">Result: </b>

             At the time I was on the project, we were still user testing Myndr with older adults to get an assessment on how much value it provides them and their caretaker.  Those people who were already familiar with technology were able to concentrate on content-feedback for the app. Those who didn't have exposure to smart devices spent a great deal of their time figuring out how to use an iPhone.  The findings of the research, the changes we made to the app, and other data are under NDA at this time.  </p>

         <p>I was always interested in the intersection of technology and older-age people who didn't grow up with computers and smart devices.  On one hand you see savvy grandmothers with iPads, and on the other hand is my grandad who still writes letters and struggles to understand the value of a cellphone. </p>
          
        <p> I learned a lot during this research project about the discord between technology and elderly people.  Those who are unfamiliar with tehnology are frustrated, alienated, and sick of the attention and glamour surrounding it.  Those who have learned and kept up with technology find it fascinating and brilliant that apps like Myndr and Skype can let them talk to grandkids at any time of day. </p>
     
         <p>  Seeing these polarized conceptions of technology shows that if technology is to become ubiquitous, much more work has to be done in the domains of late adoption and intuitive user-centric design. </p>
