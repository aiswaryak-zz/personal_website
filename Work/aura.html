            <p>I spent May-August 2010 working with nanotechnology research institute <a href = "http://www2.imec.be/be_en/home.html">imec</a href> in Leuven, Belgium.  (What a Euro trip that was!).  One of my projects was to design the initial drawings and specs for  a concept recumbent bike. Today, the project has been renamed to <a href="http://www.thinkcore.be/website/moby.php?language=en">MobiOne</a>.   </p>

            <p> The aim was to design a concept vehicle with a futuristic aesthetic and high-technology integration. The target market was Europeans that commute in the big cities - crowded, dense, and restrictive to cars.  The opportunity lay in the segment between bicycle commuters that are everywhere and the burdensome car commuters that are stuck in traffic.  </p>

            <p><b style="color:#d9401e">Result: </b> A fellow <a href = "http://www.markmuraoka.com/">intern</a> and I designed <i>Aura</i>, a 3-wheeled recumbed pedal-powered electric vehicle that aims to preseve the exhilaration of a bicycle ride and integrate the comfort of a car.  Our user segment demanded this option if it was modern, attractive, and kept them less sweaty on the way to work.  Aura is a sustainable creation, with a 'cradle-to-cradle' manufacturing cycle. </p>

            <p>In <i>Aura</i>, the back can be used for storage, and the two paddle shifters next to the driver are used for navigating the vehicle. There is a device holder in the front where the driver can place their smart device and their preferred settings (audio, climate) are enabled.</p>

        <p> Engineering design: rear-hub electric motor, the mechanical system, integration with pedal power.  Controls system: allows the vehicle to decide when to provide electric-assist, smartphone integration (manufacturer-agnostic). Physical design: We sketched many initial designs of the interior and exterior. We took them to our users to get feedback on what appealed to young European commuters.  The final design was picked and below are the dimensions of <i>Aura</i>.</p>

      <p style = "margin-top:10px">Ecosystem:  Aura is more than just a vehicle. It is an accessory, a partner in connecting with the community via the smartphone.  The high-tech integration allows the modern-day commuter to embrace the power of personalization, activity tracking, and sustainable transportation.</p>

         <p>I worked with an expert artist, engineering students at the GroepT university in Belgium, and my imagination.  It was a very rewarding experience to design a system from a blank state. </p> 
      <p>The following summer, Aura was put into the prototype stage by imec. Today the project is <a href="http://www.thinkcore.be/website/moby.php?language=en">MobiOne</a> and the team is starting to look for partners to sponsor their design work.   I am excited to see vehicles like MobiOne become a reality for a future where placing more cars on the roads of fixed city infrastructure will be unsustainable. </p>
