            <p>There are teams within Ford that work in production and focus on porting features onto different infotainment systems (usually vary with region of the world) and different vehicle platforms (Fiesta vs. Explorer vs. F150). Then there are teams within Ford that work on future features. They don't worry about cross-platform integration or internationalization. Their main focus is on ideation, incorporating new technology, and envisioning how the car is a connected by becoming "another device in the Internet of things." </p>

            <p> I am part of the latter organization, Ford Research. Here we work on future features for infotainment systems.<p>

            <p>My team works on a variety of future features for tech-savvy Ford drivers.
            </p>

            <p> In the prototyping process, my job is to wireframe, storyboard, and mockup what the consumer interaction with a feature on several devices and scenarios.  I also do some UI software development and vehicle-level development for other HMI projects.  For example, I am working on basic visual design and web development for Ford's <a href = "http://corporate.ford.com/microsites/sustainability-report-2012-13/financial-mobility-blueprint">Blueprint for Mobility </a>.Below I list some skills I've gained in my early career at Ford.  Currently, I am unable to go into project details since my work is Ford Confidential.    </p></p>

                <li> <b>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript</b>: I was a beginner in web development in college. Once I came to Ford, the push for rapid prototyping meant that I've been practicing. I notice a great benefit to building websites mobile-responsively.  We can port the webpage onto a phone, tablet, and a prototype vehicle infotainment screen to display new apps and features.  The use of Bootstrap has accelerated my development process as well.  I am currently learning Angular.js to better populate my features with personalized content. </li>

                <li> <b>JSON, XML, and APIs </b>: Automakers realize that the vehicle needs to keep up with the smartphone. The quickest solution has been to rely on the same data source that smartphone apps pull from - a user's cloud account.  I've had the opportunity to prototype in-vehicle and mobile features for the consumer by accessing the content they use in daily life. This requires pulling content from web services via their APIs.  In order to create demos like the <a href = "http://www.roadandtrack.com/go/news/concept-cars/ford-evos-concept-connects-cloud-at-ces-28515">EVOS Concept Car</a>, we at Research, pull interesting and necessary information into the car for our driver and passengers. </li>

                <li><b>Embedded development in C, C#, and Qt/QML </b>: It's important to be able to connect our feature prototypes to the vehicle too. Working in embedded frameworks allows us to build UIs, connect to the cloud, as well as access the vehicle CAN network to monitor signals.  The CAN network can tell me when a driver is pressing on the gas, or put the car into park, or if the climate control turned on.  Part of my job is to think about how the vehicle status can be used to make the car smarter, the cloud smarter, and in turn, help the driver. </li>

                <li><b>Six-sigma and user testing</b>: Working in Research means that I have the freedom to test with users - mostly those internal to the company (hey, they aren't all engineers).  I conducted company-wide surveys on driver mindsets and I conducted focused usability clinics on a certain feature prototype.  I have learned how data can be collected on various levels of breadth and depth, and  I'm using that to make better judgments on testing methodology  </li>

                <li><b>Visual and Information design</b>: Our features employ visuals to illustrate how they fit into the future of Ford infotainment/mobile app/website. The visuals are done in Illustrator, Photoshop, and sometimes Balsamiq (if we need less-fidelity) and passed onto software developers for implementation. I get to work on a lot of this graphical content for our team. I use the mockups in usability tests to 1) ensure the information flow is easy and 2) the presentation is appealing to the driver.  </li>
