            <p>There are teams within Ford that work in production and focus on porting features onto different infotainment systems (usually vary with region of the world) and different vehicle platforms (Fiesta vs. Explorer vs. F150). Then there are teams within Ford that work on future features. They don't worry about cross-platform integration or internationalization. Their main focus is on ideation, incorporating new technology, and envisioning how the car is a connected by becoming "another device in the Internet of things." </p>

            <p> I am part of the latter organization, Ford Research. Here we work on future features for infotainment systems.<p>

			<p>My team works on a variety of future connectivity features for Ford drivers.
            </p>

            <p> In the prototyping process, my job is to wireframe, storyboard, and mockup what the consumer interaction with a feature on several devices and scenarios.  Following this, I do some UI software development and vehicle-level development to put a prototype in the car.  Then I recruit and interview users on the prototype, gather feedback, and iterate on the design.    </p></p>

            <p>Starting July 2014, I am a direct hire of Kelly Services and on assignment at Ford.  Previously from July 2013 - June 2014, I was a full-time direct hire at Ford.  However, since the start (June 2013), I've been working in the same Research team. </p>

			<ul>
			
			<li> <b> Team bonding matters: </b>  Recently I designed, organized, and led our department's first Ideation Session. The day-long Ideation Session did not involve the use of a single laptop.  Everything was done with post-its, sharpies, and discussion.  I learned that we needed to step away from our desks for a while and engage with one another on our ideas.  I learned that when we get together and brainstorm in teams, we encourage, inspire, learn, and humor each other.  At the end of the day, our department knows each other better and now we reach out to colleagues for knowledge sharing.  I think that's one of the best outcomes from this session - one that none of us had in mind.  
			</li>
			
			<li> <b> How to work within the structure</b>: Not everyday do you get to work in one of the world's most well-known brands.  With many cars come many employees.  Thousands of people have to be managed across systems, regions, vehicle platforms, and technologies at Ford.  I'm learning to understand how to quickly learn, adapt, and utilize the different processes at Ford. If something can be made better, I try it out.  If I am able to introduce a new process, I try to evangelize it.
			</li>
			
						
			<li> <b> Usability testing of a different kind: </b>  Think about usability testing a website prototype.  How many users have issues understanding and executing tasks while sitting at a desk?  Now add in a car and the act of driving.  User research and usability testing for vehicle features can be tricky.  Over the past two years, I've tested many methods to test a feature without overwhelming the user.  Today, I employ a few different variations to usability tests to get the feedback I need while giving the user a relatively-decent driving experience.</li>
			
			<li> <b> A/B testing in research is more like A/B/X/Y/Z testing: </b>  Most A/B testing I hear about is for incremental changes in design.  Users test a slight variation and give feedback. However, those rules go out the door in Research.  Here, we're all about testing a spread of concepts.  Content, placement, and copy vary vastly between prototypes.  We want users to openly discuss and react to our prototypes and even help us co-design new versions that better fit their needs.  The A/B testing process in research is more aggressive, open-ended, exploratory.  It's all about the big differences.</li>
			
			<li> <b> In-vehicle and out-of-vehicle </b>:  Often, it's important to figure out whether we, as a car company, should work on a feature.  It's important that we test features inside and outside the vehicle to best understand how it fits into a user's life.  Sometimes it's too early or late if the feedback appears in-vehicle.  Sometimes, the best place for the feature is on the phone, and not the car.  I'm learning to answer these questions early in the feature development process so we can tailor it to the right platform. </li>

              <ul>

                <li> <b>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, AngularJS</b>: I was a beginner in web development in college. Once I came to Ford, the push for rapid prototyping meant that I've been practicing. I notice a great benefit to building websites mobile-responsively.  We can port the webpage onto a phone, tablet, and a prototype vehicle infotainment screen to display new apps and features.  The use of Bootstrap has accelerated my development process as well.  I am currently learning Angular.js to better populate my features with personalized content. </li>

                <li> <b>JSON, XML, and APIs </b>: Automakers realize that the vehicle needs to keep up with the smartphone. The quickest solution has been to rely on the same data source that smartphone apps pull from - a user's cloud account.  I've had the opportunity to prototype in-vehicle and mobile features for the consumer by accessing the content they use in daily life. This requires pulling content from web services via their APIs.  In order to create demos like the <a href = "http://www.roadandtrack.com/go/news/concept-cars/ford-evos-concept-connects-cloud-at-ces-28515">EVOS Concept Car</a>, we at Research, pull interesting and necessary information into the car for our driver and passengers. </li>

                <li><b>Embedded development in C, C#, and Qt/QML </b>: It's important to be able to connect our feature prototypes to the vehicle too. Working in embedded frameworks allows us to build UIs, connect to the cloud, as well as access the vehicle CAN network to monitor signals.  The CAN network can tell me when a driver is pressing on the gas, or put the car into park, or if the climate control turned on.  Part of my job is to think about how the vehicle status can be used to make the car smarter, the cloud smarter, and in turn, help the driver. </li>

                <li><b>Six-sigma and user testing</b>: Working in Research means that I have the freedom to test with users - mostly those internal to the company (fyi, they aren't all engineers).  I conduct company-wide surveys on driver mindsets and I conduct focused usability clinics on a certain feature prototypes.  The method depends on the question I want to answer.  I collect user data on various levels of breadth and depth, and  I'm using that to make better design decisions.   </li>
				

                <li><b>Visual and Information design</b>: Our features employ visuals to illustrate how they fit into the future of Ford infotainment/mobile app/website. The visuals are done in Illustrator, Photoshop, and sometimes Balsamiq (if we need less-fidelity) and passed onto software developers for implementation. I get to work on a lot of this graphical content for our team.  </li>
